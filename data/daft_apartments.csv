Private Resident Amenities  
Can’t face driving through bumper-to-bumper traffic to watch the latest big-screen blockbuster in an expensive picture house? Well, Mount Argus has its very own modern cinema, which screens an array of top movies and big footie games. A self-contained world, the apartment complex also boasts a superb state-of-the-art gym – suitably refreshed after a weights or cardio session, you can then relax in the residents’ lounge for more chilled-out downtime. 


The Apartments – One, Two and Three bedroom
A brand new development (that’s never been lived in), Mount Argus offers a quality of life that other developments simply can’t match. Nestling near verdant village parks, hipster eateries and the Grand Canal, the architecturally slick apartment complex includes a range of expertly designed and constructed one, two and three-bedroom apartments that cater for all the needs of modern individuals.
 
All of Mount Argus’s spacious rooms are fitted with relaxing, fashionable furniture, and each light-filled apartment boasts private balconies or terraces, which allow for stunning views of local and urban landmarks. You can also while away the time in the landscaped resident’s courtyard or chilled-out residents’ area. Inside, the thermostatically-controlled central heating ensures life in Mount Argus is always warm and inviting for residents … and their dogs and cats (the complex is pet-friendly). 

These spacious apartments are ideal for modern living, Mount Argus are happy to supply their residents with the option of a desk as part of the move in furniture package. Ask your letting agent about providing a desk free of charge as part of your welcome package and work in your new home in comfort.
 
Eco-friendly Mount Argus has substantial, secure bicycle storage space, and there is ample car parking in the basement.     
     
Kitchens/Dining areas
Mount Argus’s purpose-designed kitchens are fitted with hi-spec accessories that are designed to make residents’ lives that little bit easier. No detail is left untouched, as demonstrated by the user-friendly worktops, and expertly designed – and generous – storage spaces. As eye-catching are the top-of-the-range fridge freezers, dishwashers and combi ovens. Furthermore, the apartments have utility-storage rooms with washer-dryer machines, and there are supplementary storage room-home offices in the hallway.  
 
Living Rooms
Contemporary and comfortable, the well-proportioned living rooms are designed to blend in with the bespoke furniture that comes with the apartments. Elegantly designed, they are all wired for TV, cable, satellite and broadband services. Sit back and relax …    
 
Bedrooms
Mount Argus’s spacious one, two and three-bedroom apartments are fitted with comfortable soft furnishings and elegant, purpose-designed furniture. Of course, generous fitted wardrobes are standard in all sleeping spaces, which include television, cable, satellite and broadband.  
 
Bathrooms
The main bathrooms include attractive, modern shower-bath combi systems – naturally, our en-suites are all fitted out with invigorating showers. 
 
Service
To ensure everything runs smoothly in your new home in Mount Argus, the dedicated team at Hooke & MacDonald are on hand to assist in any management or maintenance queries. An expert onsite residents’ manager will help with all your needs and queries. The array of onsite services includes a super-efficient dry-cleaning system – which allows you to pick up your clothes, at the push of a button, when you need them – and a secure, on-time parcel-management service. Peace of mind is guaranteed by our 24 hour-accessible resident’s online app. 

 
Rapid Transport Links  
A true neighbourhood, Harold’s Cross is served by multiple bus routes – the 9, 16, 49, 54A and 83 will speed you in to town, the 16 connects to Dublin Airport and a Nightlink service (49N) will get revelers back from that nightclub – but you don’t have to rely on public transport, as the village is so central. An amble into St Stephen’s Green will take around 30 mins and a Dublinbike (or your own bicycle) will get you there in around 10 … about the same it takes to drive to the M50. 

Leading Leisure 
Budding Federers and Serenas will love Rathgar Tennis Club, while the Leinster Cricket and Kenilworth Bowling clubs offer more relaxed recreation. The Swan Leisure complex’s swimming pool is popular with beginners and expert front-crawlers, while Satya Yoga Club provides a calming alternative. Furthermore, the area brims with soccer and rugby clubs, while Bushy Park, Harold’s Cross Park, Eamonn Ceannt Park and the Grand Canal are walkers’ paradises.  


Superb shopping
In the heart of Rathmines is the bustling Swan Shopping Centre, which includes a large Dunnes Stores outlet, Omniplex Cinema (opposite the retro Stella cinema), bookshops, butchers and more. Even more local is Harolds Cross’s handy Centra store, while nearby Kimmage has a superb SuperValu. Hipster-friendly Portobello and South Richmond St are famed for their ethnic food markets, while Grafton Street – just 20-25 minutes walk – brims with big-names stores. 
              
Bustling bars and eateries
An appetiser …
Peggy Kelly’s and the Harold House are friendly “locals”, Rathmines’s lively watering holes include Roddy Bolands and Blackbird, and The Bleeding Horse is a cosmopolitan establishment across the canal. Craft on Harold’s Cross Road and Clanbrassil St’s Konkan Indian restaurant are just two of the acclaimed eateries. Then there’s Five Points Café, Beckett & Bull … 

Excellent schools
Like other well-established Dublin neighbourhoods, Harold’s Cross has plenty of school and childcare options (including crèches) for its residents. The lengthy list of prestigious local primary and secondary schools includes The High School; Alexandra College; Stratford College; St. Louis Primary and High Schools; St. Mary's College; Our Lady's School; and Terenure College. Of course, these are all within easy reach, so lengthy, stressful commutes aren’t necessary.

Can’t face driving through bumper-to-bumper traffic to watch the latest big-screen blockbuster in an expensive picture house? Well, Mount Argus has its very own modern cinema, which screens an array of top movies and big footie games. A self-contained world, the apartment complex also boasts a superb state-of-the-art gym – suitably refreshed after a weights or cardio session, you can then relax in the residents’ lounge for more chilled-out downtime. 


The Apartments – One, Two and Three bedroom
A brand new development (that’s never been lived in), Mount Argus offers a quality of life that other developments simply can’t match.

Kitchens/Dining areas
Mount Argus’s purpose-designed kitchens are fitted with hi-spec accessories that are designed to make residents’ lives that little bit easier. No detail is left untouched, as demonstrated by the user-friendly worktops, and expertly designed – and generous – storage spaces. As eye-catching are the top-of-the-range fridge freezers, dishwashers and combi ovens. Furthermore, the apartments have utility-storage rooms with washer-dryer machines, and there are supplementary storage room-home offices in the hallway.  
 
Living Rooms
Contemporary and comfortable, the well-proportioned living rooms are designed to blend in with the bespoke furniture that comes with the apartments. Elegantly designed, they are all wired for TV, cable, satellite and broadband services. Sit back and relax …

Bustling bars and eateries
An appetiser …

A centralised heating system and cold water storage solution have been installed and this results in more apartment space for the occupier which is not taken up by plant. Each unit has a district heating sub- station and this meters the energy used by the occupant to heat the apartment and generate hot water. While the boiler plant is not in the apartment each occupier can adjust the operating conditions they require. In tandem with this modern heating solution the apartments have been built with high levels of insulation and air tightness, both of which ensure that heating bills will be lowered. To maintain comfort in the apartments each unit is fitted with a heat recovery ventilation system. The air in the apartment is constantly cycled with stale damp air being removed and fresh outside air in added, in a controlled manner. The heating from the outgoing air stream is transferred across to the incoming fresh air and this greatly limits the heat losses to the space.

The Pavilion is beside the sea in Dun Laoghaire, 200m from the train station, and a short distance from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn etc. (16 mins by Dart to Grand Canal Dock station) and the IFSC (24 mins to Connolly station). The Aircoach direct airport bus stops outside the Pavilion every hour, day and night. Elegant, spacious, secure and bright (south-facing) three-bedroom apartment (unfurnished) on the fourth floor of the high-spec Pavilion II building, Dun Laoghaire. The Pavilion was designed by the modernist architects Scott Tallon Walker (recipients of a number of AIA, RIAI and RIBA awards). Wired for internet (Cat 5 sockets), telephone and TV. The Pavilion is maintained to a high standard and is very well located - next door to a large supermarket, the 19th century Royal Marine Hotel, Lexicon library, Pavilion theatre & cinema, and a gym. It is close to restaurants, cafes, cinemas and schools, Dun Laoghaire Dart train station (200m away) and the beautiful Dun Laoghaire harbour (250m away). The apartment faces south-southwest and catches light throughout the day. It is very large, approximately 104 m2 in area, and was recently decorated in neutral colours. The atmosphere is very calm, with interesting views of Marine Road and the Dublin Mountains. The main room (dining / living / kitchen) is almost as large as a one-bedroom apartment (i.e. slightly over 40 m2 in area - including a separate kitchen with a dishwasher and well-designed storage). The apartment is unfurnished so a number of layouts are possible as it will accommodate a range of furniture types. The main room leads to a small balcony. The apartment has three bedrooms. The main bedroom - separated from the rest of the space - is large (28 m2), with floor to ceiling windows, ample storage, and an en suite bathroom (with shower/bath, toilet and bidet). At the opposite end of the apartment there are two double bedrooms and a shared bathroom (with shower, toilet and storage). The middle-sized bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe and floor to ceiling windows. The third bedroom could also be used as a home office. Storage: the apartment has a decent-sized cupboard in the hall, and a utility room off the living main room (for hot water tank and washing machine / dryer). The Pavilion II building has a combined heat and power system that provides heating and hot water for the apartments. One secure underground parking spot - with direct access from the lift - can be provided. Secure bicycle parking is also available. ""Transport links are excellent: a) Aircoach 703 - bus stop outside front door for an hourly, around the clock, direct service to Dublin Airport; b) Dart - the train to Dublin city centre is one minute's walk from the front door. Travel times are excellent - 16 mins to Grand Canal Dock station (LinkedIn / Google / Facebook), 19 mins to Pearse station (TCD), and 24 minutes to Connolly station (IFSC). Long distance trains also stop at this station; c) Bus 7 - to city centre and Cherrywood Luas (light rail - Green Line); d) Bus 46a - to UCD, city centre and Phoenix Park; e) Bus 63 - to Kilternan; f) Bus 75 - to Tallaght; and, g) Go-Car short term rental system (cars by the hour).

Greens/browns and creams are the order of the day with the décor, which has a very restful effect. The kitchen is a lovely pale white with a vein of grey going through it, very contemporary indeed. All modern appliances make for easy living.  The  double bedroom has good levels of storage and the bathroom comprises both bath and shower and has plenty of storage too. 

There is a separate storage cupboard located off the hallway, always very important in apartment living. 

All in all, a beautifully presented apartment in a fantastic location. One will never be short of that pint of milk with the large well stocked Centra right at the doorstep and once Level 5 restrictions are lifted, places like the nearby ""Barge pub"" will become a reality once again........here's hoping!!!","Harcourt Green, Dublin 2","['Central Heating', 'Cable Television', 'Washing Machine', 'Dryer', 'Microwave', 'Internet', 'Garden / Patio / Balcony']",Keary Estates,"['https://photos.cdn.dsch.ie/N2Y2MjY4NzNkYTBjYWVkNTczYjNlM2RkN2M2NzY4YTaE28jh11ioGOZRsLlYHctmaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYW1hc3Rlci1zM2V1LzkvNy85NzIzMmRhYmM5ZGY5ZWIwOTFhZGUwN2EwNjRiZWMyYi5qcGd8fHx8fHwxNDQweDk2MHx8fHw=', 'https://photos.cdn.dsch.ie/MmI2NTljNDQxNjZhZmI0Nzc0MDZmZjA2MTA0MWJiYTE9cgToaEVSGu3MGY_Hl_i6aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYW1hc3Rlci1zM2V1LzUvMy81M2RlM2VlMDk3ZjUwMjc4NThhYTRlNjcyOGM5NjZiMS5qcGd8fHx8fHwzNjB4MjQwfHx8fA==', 'https://photos.cdn.dsch.ie/Yzk5ODEyMGRjZTM0NzRhOTExM2ExNmIzN2E3ZDY4ZDbAgdI2raAJ3gea0Hd05diDaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYW1hc3Rlci1zM2V1LzEvYS8xYWM5MTdkZmExZmI5M2ZmZWNiMzkxYTIzM2E2MWJjOC5qcGd8fHx8fHwzNjB4MjQwfHx8fA==', 'https://photos.cdn.dsch.ie/MGE0ODZlMDExMWEwOTkyNDE5MDg2YWVmM2RkNzAzZWFy7evVXtc9aEbNPyBNQotOaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy1ldS13ZXN0LTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9tZWRpYW1hc3Rlci1zM2V1LzgvNS84NTNhYTU0NGNjZmUyZjI2MzUzMmU1ZWU0NmFlOWMzZi5qcGd8fHx8fHwzNjB4MjQwfHx8fA==']",1700,844,2021-03-19,month

#1 - LOCATION. If you are moving to Dublin City or thinking of relocating - Custom House Harbour is the best and quietest complex in the IFSC. It is a secure/gated complex and has the best tranquil location and water views of the inner dock, making it really quiet and peaceful. This apartment is in the prime position with the Custom House Harbour complex also - it is nice and high up on the 4TH FLOOR, is not overlooked by other apartments and comes fully furnished/ready to move in.
 
Forget wasting money on taxis - everything is walking distance from here. Or take a nearby CityBike if you wish to go further afield. The apartment is also right next door to Connolly station, LUAS, DART and bus routes - literally 30 seconds away! Great when we come out of Lockdown.

#2 LOW BILLS. The living area is warm, bright and spacious and leads to a sunny south facing balcony overlooking the water views from the IFSC Inner Dock - for this reason the apartment barely needs to be heated. 

#3 FINALLY. The property is in excellent condition throughout and comprises an entrance hall, 2 bedrooms (one double and one single), living room and kitchen.

The property itself boasts high ceilings, contemporary and stylish furniture and fittings. It has a full central heating system fitted throughout.

 Ample storage in both bedrooms is a greatly appealing factor too with full size double wardrobes. The guest bedroom also works as a home office with a sofa and desk which is perfect for when you need some privacy or as a secondary living room away from the kitchen/ living/ dining area. 
 
The spacious shower room is graphic and stylish with its unique character and design. With various ambient lighting options -  it truly is a place to relax and unwind.

The living room is bright, spacious and well proportioned – with a large comfortable 3 seat sofa. The lighting scheme is considered and adjustable to your preference.

The brand new kitchen area features all integrated appliances and necessary cups, plates, glasses & cutlery. There is also a coffee dock/ breakfast bar that looks out onto the square. Although with the abundance of coffee shops and local eateries one might be hard pressed to not venture outside for this.

Located in one of the most enviable location in Dublin 8, beside Jury\'s Hotel and directly opposite Christchurch Cathedral, this first floor 1 bedroom apartment offers a huge amount.
 A must see!

On entering the property one is immediately struck by the abundance of natural light that floods through the apartment. Both the living room and master bedroom have large windows. 

Accommodation includes a large living room/dining space. One of the many unique selling points of the apartment is that the living room and kitchen are separate spaces. It is rare in 1 bedroom city centre apartments to find this combined with your own private courtyard.

The bedroom is a large double with an abundance of storage space. The additional storage space will be hugely beneficial to a tenant. Standard bedroom built in storage can be lacking in city centre apartments, but Apt 20 bucks this trend.

The kitchen, as stated above, is a separate space but with a cleverly introduced glazing panel . This allows additional natural light to flood into the kitchen from the living space. As the kitchen was reconfigured by the current owner, additional storage space and countertop have been added. This now amounts to a usable, spacious kitchen for the budding chef in all of us.

Location is second to none. Within minutes walk one can find yourself at Trinity College, Grafton Street, Green & Red LUAS line, Dart Station at Pearse Street. Local amenities include Jurys Hotel, Dawson Street Restaurants and Temple Bar.

There is a two seater couch in this room. There is no dining table but potentially room for a small two seater if you wanted to put one in.

There is then a separate double bedroom with walk in wardrobe, and a small bathroom with shower, sink and toilet.
